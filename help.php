<br><br>A: We do a preliminary review on uploaded videos through both a manual and automated process. Although we try our best to detect and remove videos that violate our policy guidelines, our review process is primarily focused on removing adult content or obvious copyright violations, and is not bulletproof. However, we encourage our viewers to notify us when they discover policy violations or copyright issues -- we have a process for reviewing reported policy violations, and respond to reported copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is this .MSWMM file? How do I create a movie with Windows Movie Maker?</span>
<br><br>A: A .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker Project file. By saving the project, it allows you to return to the movide and make modifications at a later time. However, if you're satisfied with the movie and would like to upload and share the result through DisTube, you will need to choose the "Save Movie File" option under the "File" menu (which is different from "Save Project" that creates the .MSWMM file).
